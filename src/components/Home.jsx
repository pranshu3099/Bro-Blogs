              One reason for the stir delights me and makes me incredibly happy
              as a teacher of mathematics. By all accounts, these two teenage
              math students are the exact opposite of the majority of the math
              establishment. They are female, they are African-American, and
              they come from an area which is not particularly renowned for
              producing high academic achievers. This is just an awesome turn of
              events and one which should inspire anyone — no matter what their
              gender, ethnic or socio-demographic background — that excellence
              in your chosen field of study is always attainable if you have
              enough joy and passion for what you do.
